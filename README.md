--> This ghost detector detects electromagnetic waves, I have also made LED graph to show the intensity 
    of electromagnetic waves detected by antenna.

--> Here i have used a single core wire stripped about 4cm to detect the EM waves working as an antenna.

--> Turn off all nearby electronic devices for more accurate find.

--> Try it out, you may find something. ğŸ˜‰ğŸ˜‚


--> I got a reading in my home. ğŸ¤ªğŸ˜±
